	/*
	 *  Below is the inner class defining a node in a Tree (prefix) tree.  
	 *  A node contains an array of children: one for each possible character.  
	 *  The children themselves are nodes.
	 *  The i-th slot in the array contains a reference to a child node which corresponds 
	 *  to character  (char) i, namely the character with  ASCII (and UNICODE) code value i. 
	 *  Similarly the index of character c is obtained by "casting":   (int) c.
	 *  So children[97] = children[ (int) 'a']  would reference a child node corresponding to 'a' 
	 *  since (char)97 == 'a'   and  (int)'a' == 97.
	 * 
	 *  To learn more:
	 * -For all unicode charactors, see http://unicode.org/charts
	 *  in particular, the ascii characters are listed at http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0000.pdf
	 * -For ascii table, see http://www.asciitable.com/
	 * -For basic idea of converting (casting) from one type to another, see 
	 *  any intro to Java book (index "primitive type conversions"), or google
	 *  that phrase.   We will cover casting of reference types when get to the
	 *  Object Oriented Design part of this course.
